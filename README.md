# React + Vite
# This is a simple user management app created using react 

In this app data are fetched from the MOCK API using AXIOS and any changes that are made by users will be reflected in the API . 
I'm also using the local state to store data fetched from API . By using local state we can also fetch data from local so that performance can be aided .
